%% Tutorial for xml_io_tools Package
% *By Jarek Tuszynski*
%
% Package xml_io_tools can read XML files into MATLAB struct and writes 
% MATLAB data types to XML files with help of simple interface to 
% MATLAB's xmlwrite and xmlread functions.
% 
% Two function to simplify reading and writing XML files from MATLAB:
%
% * Function xml_read first calls MATLAB's xmlread function and than 
% converts its output ('Document Object Model' tree of Java objects) 
% to tree of MATLAB struct's. The output is in the format of nested 
% structs and cells. In the output data structure field names are based on
% XML tags.
%
% * Function xml_write first convert input tree of MATLAB structs and cells 
% and other types to tree of 'Document Object Model' nodes, and then writes 
% resulting object to XML file using MATLAB's xmlwrite function. .
%
%% This package can:
% * Read most XML files, created inside and outside of MATLAB, and 
%   convert them to MATLAB data structures.
% * Write any MATLAB's struct tree to XML file
% * Handle XML attributes in the same way as xml_toolbox package
% * Handle special XML nodes like comments, processing instructions and 
%   CDATA sections
% * Be studied, modified, customized, rewritten and used in other packages 
%   without any limitations. All code is included and documented. Software
%   is distributed under MIT Licence (included).   
%
%% This package does not:
% * Guarantee to recover the same Matlab objects that were saved. If you 
% need to be able to recover carbon copy of the structure that was saved 
% than you will have to use one of the packages that uses special set of 
% tags saved as xml attributes that help to guide the parsing of XML code. 
% This package does not do that.
% * Guarantee to work with older versions of MATLAB. Functions do not work
% with versions of MATLAB prior to 7.1 (26-Jul-2005). Versions starting 
% with 7.1 seem to work on my machine, which have current java engine and 
% libraries. 
%
%% Change History
% * 2006-11-06 - original version
% * 2006-11-26 - corrected xml_write to handle writing Matlab's column
%   arrays to xml files. Bug discovered and diagnosed by Kalyan Dutta.
% * 2006-11-28 - made changes to handle special node types like: 
%   COMMENTS and CDATA sections 
% * 2007-02-20 - Writing CDATA sections still did not worked. The problem 
%   was diagnosed and fixed by Alberto Amaro. The fix involved rewriting
%   xmlwrite to use Apache Xerces java files directly instead of MATLAB's 
%   XMLUtils java class.
% * 2007-06-20 - Fixed problem reported by Anna Kelbert in Reviews about 
%   not writing attributes of ROOT node. Also: added support for Processing
%   Instructions, added support for global text nodes: Processing
%   Instructions and comments, allowed writing tag names with special
%   characters
% * 2007-07-19 - Added tutorial script file. Extended support for global
%   text nodes. Added more Preference fields.
% * 2008-01-05 - Fixed problem reported by Anna Krewet of converting dates 
%   in format '2007-01-01' to numbers. Improved and added warning messages.
%   Added detection of old Matlab versions incompatible with the library.
%   Expanded documentation.
% * 2008-06-14 - Fixed problem with writing 1D array reported by Mark Neil. 
%   Extended xml_read's Pref.Num2Str to 3 settings (never, smart and always) 
%   for better control. Added parameter Pref.KeepNS for keeping or ignoring 
%   namespace data when reading. Fixed a bug related to writing 2D cell
%   arrays brought up by Andrej's Mosat review.

%  element content that is marked for the parser to interpret as only 
%  character data, not markup." (from Wikipedia) 
% To insert CDATA Sections one use special CDATA_SECTION field,

%% Write XML files with special characters in TAG names
% The input to xml_write requires that all tags one wants in XML document 
% have to be encoded as field names of MATLAB's struct's. Matlab has a lot
% of restrictions on variable names. This section is about XML tags with
% names not allowed as MATLAB variables, or more specifically with
% characters allowed as xml tag names but not allowed as MATLAB variable
% names. Characters like that can be replaced by their hexadecimal
% representation just as it is done by genvarname function. Alternative way
% of writing the first example is:
MyTree=[];
MyTree.('MyNumber') = 13;               % same as MyTree.MyNumber = 13;
MyTree.MyString.CONTENT = 'Hello World';
MyTree.MyString.ATTRIBUTE.('Num') = 2;  % same as MyTree.MyString.ATTRIBUTE.Num = 2;
xml_write('test.xml', MyTree);
type('test.xml')

%%
% *This approach fails for some characters like dash '-', colon ':', and
% international characters.*
MyTree=[];

  MyTree.MyString.CONTENT = 'Hello World';
  MyTree.MyString.ATTRIBUTE.('Num_ö') = 2;
catch
  err = lasterror;
  disp(err.message);
end

%%
% It can be overcome by replacing offending characters with their 
% hexadecimal representation. That can be done manually or with use of 
% genvarname function. Note that MATLAB 'type' function does not show
% correctly 'ö' letter in xml file, but opening the file in editor shows 
% that it is correct.

% '_DASH_' and '_COLON_' respectively*

%% Write XML files with Namespaces
